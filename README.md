This project focuses on analyzing the MBTA transit system using real-time data extracted through the MBTA API, which is updated weekly. The data is visualized and analyzed using Apache Superset, while AutoML techniques are applied to predict delays and identify key transit patterns. 

The project integrates Text2SQL via Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the database through natural language queries. Additionally, Generative AI is incorporated to enhance the systemâ€™s analytical capabilities, providing advanced insights and automating complex analyses. 

The primary objective is to improve transit reliability, optimize resource allocation, and support strategic decision-making, ultimately aiming to enhance operational efficiency and commuter satisfaction while aligning services with the growing demands of urban mobility.

Skills: Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run Functions, Cloud Scheduler, BigQuery), Python, EDA, Apache Superset, Text-to-SQL, Streamlit
